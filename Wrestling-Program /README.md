#This is a practice project and based of Forest Nights suggestion of making a project like this.  

## There are not really any real wrestling rules in this, its just based on strength, but it was fun to make.  IIt focused mainly on:
  1. Experementing with classes
  2. Experementing with different files
  3. Experementing with functions
  4. Experementing with "Try" and "Catch"
